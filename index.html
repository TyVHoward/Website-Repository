 <p>These are just some of my favourite games, and ill talk a bit about them here!

  <ol><strong>Terraria</strong>: I discovered this game with my friends when i was young, and became a changed person because of it. For me, it is my personal favourite game ever, and everytime i play it i get lost in its world, even after the thousands of hours i've put into it.</ol>

  
  <ol><strong>Souls Series</strong>: I love all the souls games, Whether it be All 3 dark souls games, Bloodborne, Elden ring, demons souls, or sekiro, i have plaed and enjoyed them all.<br> One of the major things i enjoy is the difficulty of these games, as in the beginning you dont have much, and are not very powerful at all, <br>then later in the game if you build your character right, you can explode in power allowing yourself to destroy anything in your way, which can feel super satisfying and gratifying since you were probably getting destroyed throughout most of the 
  game.</ol>

   
   <ol><strong>TLOZ</strong>:TLOZ stand for The Legend of Zelda, which has always been one of my favourite game series growing up. I would say that my 2 favourite in the series would be the gamecube games, Wind Waker and Twilight Princess, as those were the ones growing up i beat first, so theres definetly some nostalgia there for me, but i do usually replay them every year or so, and to me they always hold up, even if some sections are a bit janky nowadays</ol>


  
  <ol><strong>DBFZ</strong>:The last game ill have my little ramble about here is DBFZ, and its full name is Dragon Ball Fighterz. DBFZ is a 2D, 3v3 fighting game where you control a team of 3 characters from the Dragon Ball universe.<br> You pit yourself against other players to move up in the ranks and improve yourself at the game. I love DBFZ because i love dragon ball, but also because it was my first 2D fighter that i actaully got into, and it made me try other 2D fighters as well, which got me into street fighter and other games as well.<br> Not to mention the art and gameplay style of DBFZ for me is top tier, super fast paced and your never really just zoning like in other FG's, your always in the opponents face most of the time which is what i love about it.</ol>
